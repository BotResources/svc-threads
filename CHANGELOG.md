## Unreleased

### Added

- Repository bootstrap: governance files (LICENSE, CONTRIBUTING, SECURITY, SUPPORT) ahead of the service scaffold.
- CI/CD workflows mirroring the sibling services, pre-scaffold-safe: a `scaffold probe` job skips the Rust checks until `Cargo.toml` lands; CD's detect-bump no-ops without a Cargo workspace. Branch protection script (`scripts/setup-branch-protection.sh`) as the declarative required-checks source of truth.
